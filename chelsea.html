  <p>
    Chelsea Football Club is an English professional football club based in Fulham, London,
    that competes in the Premier League.
    Founded in 1905, the club's home ground since then has been Stamford Bridge.
  </p>

  <p>
    Chelsea had their first major success in 1955, when they won the league championship.
    The club's greatest period of success has come during the last two decades; winning 21 trophies since 1997.
  </p>

  <p>
    Chelsea's regular kit colours are royal blue shirts and shorts with white socks.
    The club's crest has been changed several times in attempts to re-brand the club and modernise its image.
  </p>

  <h2>History</h2>

  <p>
    In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium with the aim of turning it into a football ground.
    An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club
    to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough,
    the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club;
    names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered.
    Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook),
    opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road,
    and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.
  </p>

  <p>
    The club won promotion to the First Division in their second season,
    and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in their early years.
    They reached the 1915 FA Cup Final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford,
    and finished third in the First Division in 1920,
    the club's best league campaign to that point.
    Chelsea attracted large crowds and had a reputation for signing big-name players,
    but success continued to elude the club in the inter-war years.
  </p>

  <p>
    The late 1970s through to the '80s was a turbulent period for Chelsea.
    An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,
    star players were sold and the team were relegated.
    Further problems were caused by a notorious hooligan element among the support,
    which was to plague the club throughout the decade.
    In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, a
    cquired by Ken Bates for the nominal sum of £1,
    although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers,
    meaning the club faced losing their home.
  </p>

  <h2>Stadium</h2>

  <p>
    Chelsea have only had one home ground, Stamford Bridge,
    where they have played since the team's foundation.
    It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and
    for the first 28 years of its existence it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club
    as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football.
    In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph,
    who had also purchased nearby land with the aim of staging football matches on the now 51,000 m² site.
    Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch,
    who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park.
    Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play,
    but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the early 1970s, the club's owners announced a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans
    for a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium.
    Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and was never completed;
    the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy,
    culminating in the freehold being sold to property developers.
    Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the
    stadium was secured and renovation work resumed.
