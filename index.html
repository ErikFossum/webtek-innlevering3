      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="ingress">
        The Premier League is an English professional league for men's association football clubs that was formed in 1992. At the top of the English football league system, it is the country's primary football competition. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League. Welsh clubs that compete in the English football league system can also qualify.
      </p>

      <h2>Corporate structure and competition</h2>
      <p class="textsection">
        The Premier League is a corporation in which the 20 member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to May. Teams play 38 matches each (playing each team in the league twice, home and away), totalling 380 matches in the season. Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons; others during weekday evenings. It is colloquially known as the Premiership and outside the UK it is commonly referred to as the English Premier League (EPL).
      </p>

      <h2>Promotion and relegation</h2>
      <p class="textsection">
        A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the Football League Championship. The three lowest placed teams in Premier League are relegated to the Football League Championship, and the top two teams from the Football League Championship promoted to Premier League, with an additional club promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs
      </p>

      <h2>Finances</h2>
      <p class="textsection">
        The Premier League has the highest revenue of any football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10. In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League had net profits in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues. In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry.</p>
